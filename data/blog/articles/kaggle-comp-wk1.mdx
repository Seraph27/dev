Notes and summary of week 1 of my summer internship systex & google: The first part of my summer internship will be based in Systex (精誠資訊) with a focus on AI tools. 
In the first week, I refreshed my knowledge on python and AI (supervised training) by starting a contest on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarahhh123/logistic-regression). 

The goal of this competition is given a dataset, predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer.

### EDA
<CodeBlock
  src="other/test"
  language="python"
  scrollable
  skipLines={[[1, 6], [14, 18], [21, 25], [27, 31], [33, 37], [40, 44], [48, 52], [55, 65], [72, 76], [83, 87], [94, 302]]}
  fileName="test.py"

EDA stands for exploratory data analysis. Essentally before the process of modifying our data / train the model, we want to know certain values about our dataset, such as its shape, distributions of certain features etc..
This will help with feature engineering and gives me a better idea of what the data I'm working with look like

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train_smote)
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)
