As of writing this this website is still in its early stages of development and I plan to add 
way more stuff in the future. Since a lot of these tools are still new to me, it takes some time 
figuring out the workflow & logistics. 
I will try to add more visuals and interactable components along the way ~~(definitely not because I'm 
terrible at writing)~~. If you have any feedback, the best way to reach me is probably DMs on discord `@serafuowo`
