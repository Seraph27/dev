Hi!, I'm currently a 3rd year fulltime student at UCSD studying Math & CS. I've tinkered around in multiple fields in programming since high school including web development in Django and Next.js / Tailwind CSS, Unity and C# game development, C++ in competitive programming (codeforces), Python for webscraping and discord bots and more. I'm always exploring new fields and expanding my expertise. I'm looking for internship opportunities--send me a message at ychao@ucsd.edu!
