Hey! I'm Rex, a junior student studying Math & CS at UCSD. You can call me by my online handle seraph. I've tinkered around in multiple fields in programming for around 5 years. Here are a couple things I've done:
- Web development with Next.js & Tailwind CSS 
- Web development with Django
- Game development with Unity and C#
- Competitive programming with C++
- Scripting and discord bots with Python. 
- Java for FTC robotics 

I'm always exploring new fields and expanding my expertise. I'm also looking for internship opportunities--send me a message at ychao@ucsd.edu!
